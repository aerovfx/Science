Hello everyone,

Today I want to talk about something that sounds super “physics-y,” but is actually very “life-y”: **harmonic oscillation**. Sounds boring, right? But wait—without oscillations, there would be no music to dance to, no Wi-Fi waves for you to scroll Facebook, and… no heartbeat to skip when you see your crush!

In physics, a harmonic oscillation is a motion that repeats itself, back and forth, around an equilibrium point. But if you look closer, it’s actually the background soundtrack of the universe.

Think about it:

* Your heart beating? That’s an oscillation.
* The swing ride at the amusement park? Oscillation.
* Even your deadlines? They oscillate too… but almost always toward the “late” side. (audience laughs)

Life itself is one giant harmonic oscillation. Sometimes you’re up: you score a perfect 10, you get promoted, love is in the air. Then you’re down: you fail a test, you get dumped, or you just feel low for no reason. But here’s the key: **you never stay at the extremes forever**. Like a pendulum, you always swing back to balance, ready for the next cycle.

So instead of complaining, “Why is my life always up and down?”, just say: “Yeah, I’m living in harmonic motion, baby!” And maybe, just maybe, those oscillations are what make the soundtrack of your life unique.

Because if your life were just one flat, straight line… sorry, that’s the kind of heartbeat you only see in a hospital. (audience bursts out laughing)

Cherish your oscillations—they’re proof that you’re alive, that you’re loving, that you’re growing. And each of us, in our own way, can turn those oscillations into a melody worth remembering.

Thank you!
